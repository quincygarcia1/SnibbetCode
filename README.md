Summer/Fall project 2021

    Snibbit Code
    V 1.0.0

This is a Chrome extension that I hope will help me in my upcoming school years by quickly allowing me to store important snippets of information that I may want to keep later. The access of all of these snippets would be kept in one centralized place. On any Stack Exchange a seperate box for Snibbit Code should appear. To save a snippet on these websites, simply give the snippet an optional title, highlight what you want to save and hit the "SNIBBIT" button. All your saved stored snippets should appear in the popup window!

There are multiple personal goals that I had for this project. The first was to brush up on my Javascript along with learning HTML and CSS. The second goal was to begin working with google services including chrome storage and the chrome extension platform in general.
